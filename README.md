# Projects
This is **Susmitha Yanamadala**. I am currently pursuing **Masters in Data Science**. This repository consists of projects implemented as part of the course work and self-study.

**Projects List and Details:**

1. Heart Disease Prediction - Vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, cholesterol, and blood sugar, along with factors such as age, gender, food habits, and lifestyle, are utilized to predict the likelihood of a person being diagnosed with heart disease. Conducted exploratory data analysis to comprehend the data and applied various classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbor, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Classifier.
2. IMDB data - Created a SQLite database and applied third normal form normalization to the tables. Using the sqlite3 library in Python, the tables were successfully created and data is loaded into the database. Subsequently, SQL queries were employed in Python to retrieve the data from the database for exploratory data analysis, allowing for the discovery of valuable insights.
