# Projects
This is **Susmitha Yanamadala**. I am currently pursuing **Masters in Data Science**. This repository consists of projects implemented as part of the course work and self-study.

**Project List and Details:**

1. **Heart Disease Prediction** (python) - Vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, cholesterol, and blood sugar, along with factors such as age, gender, food habits, and lifestyle, are utilized to predict the likelihood of a person being diagnosed with heart disease. Conducted exploratory data analysis to comprehend the data and applied various classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbor, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Classifier.
2. **IMDB Data** - Created a SQLite database and applied third normal form to the tables. Using the sqlite3 library in Python, the tables were successfully created and data is loaded into the database. Subsequently, SQL queries were employed in Python to retrieve the data from the database for exploratory data analysis, allowing for the discovery of valuable insights.
3. **Bank Marketing Campaign Data** - Created a PostgreSQL database and decomposed tables to BCNF. The tables were created and data is loaded into the database using the psycopg2 library in Python. Extensive testing of the database and data analysis was conducted, involving various commands such as insert, update, delete, select, group by, order by, having and where, as well as advanced concepts like joins, subqueries, recursive queries, common table expressions (CTEs)/temporary tables, and triggers. Query execution analysis was carried out, and the cost of query execution was reduced by optimizing them through index creation. A real-time website was developed to enable data retrieval directly from the database.
4. **Movie Clustering for Recommender Systems** (R) - Data cleaning/pre-processing and analysis were conducted, focusing on features such as popularity, vote average, vote count, and release year and month for clustering purposes. Both K-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms were implemented. The outcomes of the clustering process can be leveraged to enhance Movie Recommendation Systems.
